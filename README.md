# CyberSecurity-Week9
Time spent: 3 hours to setup and let people attack

Dionaea over HTTP

## Any issues you encountered
Installing takes a while. I got a lot of errors when working with my local command prompt, so I did everything with GCP's shell. I had to upload the JSON file through command line using git instead of using the easy website upload.

## A summary of the data collected: 
Number of attacks: 278 (As of now)  
The attack I did was by pasting ```nmap 35.196.19.172 ``` in my command line.

## Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected
None
